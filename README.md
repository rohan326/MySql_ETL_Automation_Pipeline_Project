# MySql_ETL_Automation_Pipeline_Project
This project demonstrates an end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for automating data workflows using Python and MySQL. It is designed to ingest raw data from CSV/API sources, transform it into a clean, structured format, and load it into a MySQL database for analytics and reporting.
