# MySQL ETL Automation Pipeline using Python

## Problem Statement

Managing raw data from diverse sources such as CSV files, APIs, and spreadsheets can be inefficient and error-prone without automation. This project implements an automated ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to streamline data ingestion, transformation, and storage into a MySQL database, enabling reliable reporting and analysis.

## Tools and Technologies

* Python – Core programming language for ETL
* Pandas – Data extraction, cleaning, and transformation
* MySQL – Relational database for structured data storage
* SQLAlchemy / mysql-connector-python – Database connectivity and data loading
* Logging & Error Handling – Monitoring and reliability

## Data Architecture

   +----------------+       +-----------------+       +----------------+
   | Data Sources   | --->  | Transformation  | --->  |   MySQL DB     |
   | (CSV, Excel,   |       | (Python, Pandas)|       | (Clean Tables) |
   |  API, etc.)    |       |                 |       |                |

## Example Workflow

1. Extract raw data (e.g., sales records from CSV or API).
2. Apply transformations such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing columns.
3. Validate and prepare data for loading.
4. Load the transformed dataset into MySQL tables.
5. Schedule the pipeline with Cron, Airflow, or Prefect for automation.

## Future Enhancements

* Integration with **dbt** for advanced SQL-based transformations
* Support for multiple databases (PostgreSQL, Snowflake, Redshift)
* Data quality checks and unit tests
* Deployment with **Docker** for portability
* Workflow orchestration using Apache Airflow
